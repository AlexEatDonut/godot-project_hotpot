# godot-project_hotpot

A first project to get going through godot using GodotVMF and Miyakogames' FPS controller.
Assets might be mine. If they are, they **will** suck.

Assets used on some maps aren't mine.
Code taken from various other github projects. I haven't kept track of that. Sorry.

Copyright of some assets is held by Valve corporation.
Because of that, consider everything here a copyright hazard, even if it's stuff that's safe.

Not an actual working game. No additional work on this project will be done.
